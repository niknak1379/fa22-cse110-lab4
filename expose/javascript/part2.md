1. it returns 3 as the loop has 3 iterations
2. it logs 150, that is the last price(300)'s discounted price being calculated. Since it is declared using var, it is available outside of the loop
3. it is again logged 150 as that is the same as the last price calculated in the loop, and the value is availale as it was defined using var. 
4. it reutrns [50, 100, 150] as the discounted prices of the input items. 
5. it throws a variable not defined error, as i is defined inside the loop and does not exist outside.
6. it throws a variable not defined error, as discountedPrice is defined inside the loop and does not exist outside.
7. it returns 150, as finalPrice is defined in the same scope as the console log statemnet.
8. it returns [50, 100. 150] the discounted prices are calculated and stored as an array and then returned. 
9. it throws an error i is not defiend outside the scope of the loop
10. it returns 3 as that is the length of th input array.
11. it reutnrns the discounted prices array [50, 100, 150], which are the disconted prcies of the input items.
12. A. student.name B. student['Grad Year'] C. student.greeting() D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. A. "32" it converts 2 to a string and concactnates.
    B. output is 1, it converts the string to a number and subtracts
    C. 3, converts null to 0 and adds
    D. 3null, converts null to strings and adds
    E. converts true to 1 and adds = 4
    F. 0, both values are converted to zero
    G. 3undefined, it converts unefined to a string and concactnates
    H. NaN, it tries to turn undefiend to a number but is unable to, so throws NaN
14. A. true, it turns the string to a number then performs the comparison.
    B. false, it compares the ascii values of the first symbols
    C. true, == converts types if necessary so turns string to numbers
    D. false, === does not perform type conversion
    E. false, it converts true to 1 and the compares the values.
    F. true, both values are boolean, any boolean value other than 0 is true so both are true
15. both are comparison operators however, == performs type conversion if the types are mismatched while === does not and is a strict equality.
16. stored in appropriate file
17. this function will iterate through the array and by calling back to the doSomething function doubles the integer values of the array and pushes the new numbers to the newArr. thus the result will be the following array:[2, 4, 6]
18. 1, 4, 3, 2 is the output of this function.
